This is the skeleton for the final release of Mach-II 1.6. This skeleton is intended
to give you a jumpstart on building Mach-II applications by providing a basic 
template for Mach-II applications.

In addition you may use this skeleton to test your Mach-II and ColdSpring installations 
by calling the showHome event (http://server[/path]/index.cfm?event=showHome), which 
will display a page giving you basic feedback on whether or not Mach-II and ColdSpring 
are configured correctly.

Please note that beyond this simple test page, this skeleton is not a running application 
and doesn't "do" much of anything. It's provided strictly as an empty shell of a Mach-II 
application into which you put your code.
